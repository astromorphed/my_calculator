# my_calculator

A basic calculator app made in Flutter.

## Getting Started

This app was made in Flutter and can be run on Android, iOS, and most browsers.
Made as a part of my final thesis for my bachelor's in business IT, which was a writeup of
a basic Flutter workflow.

It was also my form of protest against my school making me work in Xamarin for three years. :)
